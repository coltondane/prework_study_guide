# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    The motivation to create this webpage was to help myself gather a better understanding of some of the broader concepts in the HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript languages

    I built this project to help myself and others study some of the opening concepts of becoming a developer. This includes notes for HTML, Css, Git, and JavaScript

    This webpage organizes language notes in a very user friendly and readable fassion to make the process of absorbing knowledge while studying an easier task

    This project taught me basic concepts and methods in the HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript languages. I learned a lot about the power of the command-line as well as the power of GitHub, which I was overwhelmed with when trying to navigate it on my own

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. 

When this webpage is visited the user will see different sections corresponding to different programming methods/languages. The user will see that each section has the name of the language, and some basic notes under providing the user with a general idea how each language works. The user will also see, upon opening the DevTools console, the JavaScript code working in real time. This provides the user with the concept categories, as well as a randomized suggestion for which section to study. 

## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
